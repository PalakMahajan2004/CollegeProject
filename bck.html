    <h1>What is Back-end development?</h1>
    <p id="container">
        Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t see on a website.
         Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, 
         application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases,
          store, understand, and delete data.</p>

            Backend developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites.
          Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website,
         back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.</p><br>

       <b> Build and maintain websites</b>: A back-end developer’s main responsibility is to use various tools, frameworks, and languages
         to determine how best to develop intuitive, user-friendly prototypes and turn them into websites.
          This requires an understanding of cross-platform functionality and compatibility.<br><br>
        
       <b> Write high-quality code</b>: To produce sustainable web applications, developers must write clean and easily maintainable code.<br><br>
        
       <b>Perform quality assurance (QA) testing</b> : Create and oversee testing schedules to optimize user interface and experience,

                  There are two types of databases available in the market – SQL, and NoSQL. A SQL database is one where
                   the data is mapped in a table and each one is linked to another in a significant way. SQL databases work 
                   on queries and produce results based on them. In the NoSQL database where, unlike SQL, there is no need to structure
                    the data beforehand</p>
