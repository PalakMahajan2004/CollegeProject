        <img class="data"src="data.jpg" width="300px" height="250px">

          <p>Database management in the context of a full stack developer refers to the management of databases 
            within the application development process. It involves designing, creating, and maintaining databases
             to store and retrieve data efficiently.<br>
             As a full stack developer, you are responsible for handling both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) 
             components of an application. The back-end typically involves working with a database to store, organize, and manipulate data.</p>

        <p> Full stack developers write queries to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from the database.
             They use Structured Query Language (SQL) or other query languages supported by the chosen DBMS to perform these operations. 
             Additionally, developers may implement database procedures, triggers, or functions to automate certain tasks 
             or enforce business rules.</p>
