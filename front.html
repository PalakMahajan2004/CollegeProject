 <br> <br><h2>Web Design:</h2> 
 <p class="h3">Front-end developers work closely with UI/UX designers to implement the visual and interactive elements of a website 
 or application. They take design mockups or wireframes and translate them into actual code.<br>

<h2>HTML/CSS Development:</h2>
<p class="h3">Front-end developers use <a id="link"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><strong>HTML</strong></a> (Hypertext Markup Language) and <a class="p" href="https://web.dev/learn/css/"><strong>CSS</strong></a> (Cascading Style Sheets) to structure 
 and style the content of web pages. They create the layout, typography, colors, and overall visual appearance, ensuring a consistent and
  appealing user experience.</p> 
 
<h2> JavaScript Programming:</h2>
<p class="h3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a> is a fundamental language for front-end development. Front-end developers use JavaScript to add 
 interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites or applications. They may use JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, 
 or Vue.js to streamline development and enhance efficiency.</p>
 
 <h2>Responsive Design:</h2>
 <p class="h3"> Front-end developers optimize websites or applications to be responsive across different devices and screen sizes. They utilize
   responsive design techniques and CSS media queries to ensure that the UI adapts and displays properly on desktops, tablets and mobile devices.</p>
