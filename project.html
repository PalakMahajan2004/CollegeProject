      <p>Full Stack Development is a software profession/stream where a developer deals with both the <b>Frontend (client-side)</b>
        and <b>Backend (server-side)</b> of a tech product. A Full Stack Developer is proficient in several technologies that help in
         developing a robust tech product, and thus play a major role in making decisions for the company. It is one of the high-demand 
         jobs in the software industry.</p>

         <p>Learning full-stack development will help you master a wide set of skills ranging from HTML, CSS, JavaScript
          , back-end languages (Python, PHP, Ruby), database storage, HTTP, REST, and NPM, along
           with a good set of Agile project management and soft skills.</p>

           <p>In order to become a Full-stack Development expert, you are required to fulfill the following skills sets:</p>
           <ul class="list">
            <li> Front-end Developer</li>
            <li>Back-end Development</li>
            <li>Database Handling</li>
            <li>Web Servers and APIs Exposure </li>
            <li>Basic Designing Fundamentals</li>
           </ul>

      <p>On the <b>Front end</b> A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS,
         and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements
          you see were created by a front-end developer.
                                                      full stack developers are experienced in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are fundamental technologies
         for building the user interface and handling user interactions. They are knowledgeable about front-end frameworks
          like React, Angular, or Vue.js, which enable them to develop dynamic and responsive web interfaces.</p><hr><br>
 
      <img class="logoo" src="blogo.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
        <p>On the <b>Back end</b> ,Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data
           and perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers 
           are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. Full stack developers work with
            server-side programming languages such as JavaScript (Node.js), Python, 
          Ruby, or Java. They are proficient in handling databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, and have knowledge 
          of server frameworks such as Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, or Spring Boot.</p><hr><br>

          <p>
            It's important for full stack developers to have a good understanding of <b>Database</b> concepts, query languages,
             and database management systems. This knowledge allows them to create robust and scalable applications 
             that efficiently store and retrieve data, ensuring the overall functionality and performance of the web application.
          
          Overall, a<b> full stack developer</b> is a versatile professional who can handle multiple aspects of web development,
             enabling them to create end-to-end solutions for web applications. They have a broad skill set and can adapt to different 
             technologies and frameworks as required by the project.</p><hr>

             <h1>What languages do Full Stack Developer use:</h1>
             <p> Full stack developers are free to use any set of languages that are compatible with each other and the overall
               application framework. JavaScript is a popular language often used by full-stack developers as it’s one of the very 
               few languages that can be used both on the front end and back end. Companies will most likely hire a full stack developer
                for smaller or medium-size projects. Some popular languages are:<br><br>
